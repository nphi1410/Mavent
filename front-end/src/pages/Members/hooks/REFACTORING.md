# Member Management Hook Refactoring

## Overview
This document describes the complete refactoring of the large `useMemberManagement` hook into smaller, more focused hooks following the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

## Hooks Created

### 1. `useMemberData.js`
- **Responsibility**: Manages data fetching and state
- **Key Features**:
  - Member data fetching and state management
  - Department data fetching
  - Loading and error states
  - Pagination state (total pages, total elements)
  - Data transformation from API to frontend format

### 2. `useMemberFilters.js`
- **Responsibility**: Manages filter and search state
- **Key Features**:
  - Search and filter state (search, status, role, department)
  - Filter handling functions
  - Advanced filter UI state
  - Pagination controls
  - Date range filtering

### 3. `useMemberModals.js`
- **Responsibility**: Manages UI state for modals and menus
- **Key Features**:
  - Menu toggling and click-outside handling
  - Modal open/close functions
  - Selected user state management
  - Form field change handling
  - UI state management

### 4. `useMemberActions.js`
- **Responsibility**: Handles member operations (CRUD)
- **Key Features**:
  - Update member function
  - Ban/unban member functions
  - Delete member function
  - Department matching logic
  - Error handling for operations

### 5. `useMemberManagement.js` (Main Hook)
- **Responsibility**: Composes all hooks together into a unified interface
- **Key Features**:
  - Combines state and functions from all specialized hooks
  - Provides a consistent interface for the UI components
  - Handles integration between hooks
  - Provides backward compatibility for existing components
  - Implements cross-cutting concerns

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Each hook has a clear, single responsibility
2. **Enhanced Readability**: Code is organized by function making it easier to understand
3. **Better Testability**: Smaller units of code make testing easier and more focused
4. **Easier Updates**: Changes to one aspect won't affect unrelated functionality
5. **Consistent Interface**: Original components continue to work without changes

## Implementation Approach

We used a composition pattern where:
- Each hook manages its own specific state
- The main hook composes these states together
- Hook communication is handled through callbacks and shared state
- The original interface is maintained for backward compatibility

## Hook Dependencies

```
useMemberManagement
├── useMemberData
├── useMemberFilters
├── useMemberModals
└── useMemberActions
```

## Integration Challenges Solved

1. **Circular Dependencies**: Used useRef to break circular references between hooks
2. **Naming Consistency**: Created aliases to maintain consistent API across hooks
3. **State Sharing**: Implemented proper state sharing between hooks
4. **Error Handling**: Centralized error management
5. **Effect Management**: Carefully managed effect dependencies to avoid infinite loops
